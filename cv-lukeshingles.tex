%	PERSONAL PROFILE
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Personal Statement}
I am an experienced researcher with skills in scientific software development, data analysis, and visualisation.\\

Some of my highlights in research software engineering have included writing high-performance parallel code to numerically solve systems of differential equations (to model chemical enrichment of stellar clusters and high-energy particle interactions), using matrix-based methods for solving large systems of linear equations (to determine atomic level populations), and applying Monte Carlo techniques to simulate photon interactions (radiative transfer) in three dimensions. I have also ported code to run on GPU hardware with Nvidia CUDA, contributed to open source software used by other researchers, and advocated for software engineering best-practices in collaborative projects.\\

I have a strong track record of obtaining scientific insights from computationally demanding theoretical work, having given over 17 scientific talks at professional conferences and institutes, and published 13 articles in peer-reviewed science journals.\\

I have contributed as a co-investigator on successful research grants and HPC computing time proposals for international facilities. I enjoy teaching and have chosen to gain experience tutoring and giving lectures for undergraduate physics courses, and co-supervised PhD, Master's, and Google Summer of Code students on a variety of projects in astrophysics and software development.\\
%
% Within the School of Mathematics and Physics, I have volunteered as a Postdoctoral Representatives and am a member of the Athena SWAN committee for gender equality. In these roles, I have organised social events to build connections between people in different research clusters, organised career information days with invited speakers, and supported efforts to improve diversity in STEM careers.\\


I have expertise in:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Leading the development of numerically-intensive software in C/C++
  \item Multithreading and parallel algorithms (using OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA)
  \item Debugging, performance profiling, and optimisation (gdb, perf)
  \item Collaborative development using version control (Git), continuous integration, and automated testing
  \item Scientific research with publications in peer-reviewed journals
  \item Developing tools to process and visualise large data sets to extract meaningful insights (Python with numpy, pandas, and matplotlib)
  \item Statistics, differential equations, and linear algebra (machine learning fundamentals)
\end{itemize}
