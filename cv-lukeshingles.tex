\section{Skills and interests}
  I'm an experienced researcher with a PhD in astrophysics. I'm skilled in high-performance computing, scientific software development (including Python/C/MPI/OpenMP), data analysis, and visualisation.

  I have developed and run software on various supercomputers to numerically solve systems of differential equations (e.g., for chemical enrichment of stellar clusters and high-energy particle interactions) and carried out highly-parallel ($>$1000 core) simulations of radiation transport in supernovae that use Monte Carlo algorithms. I have a strong interest in computer graphics, performance optimisation, and enjoy learning new technologies. I would like to learn more about GPU programming (CUDA/OpenCL), machine learning, and computer vision.
