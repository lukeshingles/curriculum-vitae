\section{Skills and interests}
  I am a scientist and software engineer focused on using software to solve complex problems on high-performance computers. Through my training in Software Engineering and experience in scientific research, I have been able to apply high-performance algorithms and data structures to build astrophysical simulations, while also developing skills in data analysis, visualisation, and technical communication through papers and presentations.

  Some my highlights have included writing high-performance parallel code to numerically solve systems of differential equations (e.g., to model chemical enrichment of stellar clusters and high-energy particle interactions), using matrix-based methods for solving large systems of linear equations (to determine atomic level populations), and applying Monte Carlo techniques to simulate photon interactions (radiative transfer) in three dimensions within material ejected from supernova explosions. The analysis of my theoretical simulations running on thousands of CPU cores and the comparison to real-world observations has led to research insights that have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.

  From my interest in parallel algorithms, I have naturally become excited about the use of GPUs to accelerate numerical problem-solving. My own experiments with NVIDIA CUDA have found that large performance benefits can be gained quickly, and even greater benefits can be achieved through further optimisation and a deeper understanding of the hardware. I am also interested in machine learning and computer vision, and look for opportunities to work with these technologies, to solve problems by developing optimised code for CPUs and GPUs, and to keep up with latest developments in parallel and heterogeneous computing.
