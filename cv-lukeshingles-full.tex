%	PERSONAL PROFILE
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Personal Statement}
I am an experienced researcher with skills in scientific software development, data analysis, and visualisation. I would be particularly interested in opportunities to apply GPU hardware, image processing, and machine learning algorithms.

% I have experience developing and using software on various supercomputers to solve systems of differential equations (e.g., for stellar structure and nuclear reaction networks) and carry out large-scale (>1000 core) Monte Carlo simulations of radiation and particle transport.

Some of my highlights have included: writing high-performance parallel code to numerically solve systems of differential equations (e.g., to model chemical enrichment of stellar clusters and high-energy particle interactions), using matrix-based methods for solving large systems of linear equations (to determine atomic level populations), and applying Monte Carlo techniques to simulate photon interactions (radiative transfer) in three dimensions within material ejected from supernova explosions. My analysis of my theoretical simulations running on thousands of CPU cores and the comparison to real-world observations has led to research insights that have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\\

I have:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Over four years full-time paid experience developing numerically-intensive software for scientific research (C/C++)
  \item Expertise with multithreading and parallel algorithms (OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA)
  \item Expertise with debugging, performance profiling, and optimisation (gdb, perf)
  \item Experience with collaborative development using version control (Git), continuous integration, and automated testing
  \item Over eight years experience in scientific research with publications in peer-reviewed  journals
  \item Expertise building tools to process and visualise large data sets to extract meaningful insights (Python with numpy, pandas, and matplotlib)
  \item Expertise in statistics, differential equations, and linear algebra (machine learning fundamentals)
\end{itemize}
